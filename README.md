# Dependable Distributed Systems Course Project

This repository contains the project developed for the Dependable Distributed Systems course. The project focuses on the analysis of two significant papers in the field of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs):

1. **"The Tangle"** by S. Popov (2018)
2. **"Tangle 2.0 Leaderless Nakamoto Consensus on the Heaviest DAG"** by Sebastian MÂ¨uller, Andreas Penzkofer, Nikita Polyanskii, Jonas Theis, William Sanders, Hans Moog (2022)

The analysis investigates the problems addressed and the solutions proposed in these papers, highlighting their differences and similarities. 

In addition to the analysis, the project provides an introduction to a novel technology for Tangle-based DLTs: the **"Coordicide"**, which is the main concept behind the IOTA 2.0 protocol. An in-depth explanation of this protocol is provided, based on the working paper **"The Coordicide"** (2019) by S. Popov, H. Moog, D. Camargo, A. Capossele, V. Dimitrov, A. Gal, A. Greve, B. Kusmierz, S. Mueller, A. Penzkofer, O. Saa, W. Sanders, L. Vigneri, W. Welz, and V. Attias.
